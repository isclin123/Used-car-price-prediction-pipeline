Used Car Price Prediction Pipeline📌 Project OverviewThis repository features a comprehensive, end-to-end statistical pipeline developed in R to predict used car prices. Unlike basic regression models, this project emphasizes statistical integrity, utilizing advanced imputation techniques, power transformations, and rigorous diagnostic checks to ensure the model's reliability and robustness.🛠️ Key Technical HighlightsAdvanced Data Cleaning & Imputation:Implemented MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) for numerical predictors (e.g., original_price) to handle missingness without biasing the distribution.Used mode imputation for categorical features to maintain data consistency.Feature Engineering:Handled high-cardinality categorical variables (Make, Model, City) using frequency-based lumping (fct_lump) to prevent over-parameterization.Applied Binary and One-Hot Encoding for model compatibility.Multicollinearity Management: Conducted iterative VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) analysis to prune redundant features and ensure a lean, interpretable model.Target Transformation: Utilized Box-Cox Transformation ($\lambda \approx 0.05$) to normalize the response variable (sale_price), significantly improving the adherence to linear regression assumptions.Automated Model Selection: Leveraged Stepwise BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) for a parsimonious model that balances explanatory power with simplicity.Rigorous Diagnostics:Combined Cook’s Distance, Hat Values (Leverage), and Studentized Residuals to identify influential outliers.Visualized outlier intersections using Venn Diagrams for precise data pruning.📊 Performance & ValidationRobustness Check: The model was validated using a 5-Fold Cross-Validation approach.Generalization: High consistency between Training and Testing metrics (R², RMSE, MAE) demonstrates that the model generalizes well to unseen data.📂 Repository StructureUsed_Car_Price_Prediction.R: The core R script containing the full pipeline.Used_Car_Price_Prediction.csv: The raw dataset used for analysis.plots/: (Optional) Directory for generated diagnostic plots (Residuals, QQ-plot, Venn Diagram).🚀 Getting StartedClone the repo:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Used-Car-Price-Prediction-Pipeline.git
